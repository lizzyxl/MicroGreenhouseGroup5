# MicroGreenhouse Project

This repository contains the ESP-IDF project template for the **MicroGreenhouse** developed by Group 5.  
The project is designed to monitor and control environmental conditions for a micro greenhouse using the ESP32 microcontroller. It includes support for multiple sensors and actuators (temperature, humidity, light, fans, water pumps, etc.) and is structured in a modular way using ESP-IDF components.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a modular and maintainable framework for controlling and monitoring a micro greenhouse. Each sensor and actuator has its own component folder, allowing multiple team members to work independently and integrate their modules seamlessly.
